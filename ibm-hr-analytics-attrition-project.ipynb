Approximately 45% of employees have not been promoted in the last year, while about 20% were promoted within the past 1-2 years.\n\n2. The attrition rate plot shows that employees with no recent promotions have an attrition rate of around 20%, while those who have not been promoted for 6-7 years experience an even higher attrition rate of 22%. There is an outlier at 8 years with no sign of attrition. this could be an anomaly.","metadata":{"id":"TCZKJhAh83j2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Summary of Feature Impact on Attrition:\n\n**High Impact:**\n- JobRole\n- JobLevel\n- JobInvolvement\n- YearsSinceLastPromotion\n- Department\n\n**Moderate Impact:**\n- TotalWorkingYears\n- YearsInCurrentRole\n- YearsWithCurrManager\n- TrainingTimesLastYear\n- NumCompaniesWorked\n\n**Low Impact:**\n- PerformanceRating\n- StandardHours\n","metadata":{"id":"eyZdEggX92sM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.2.3 Compensation Features\n\n\n","metadata":{"id":"1II60Lbi4b99"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### MonthlyRate, MonthlyIncome","metadata":{"id":"uhZSPNgq5q7x"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Convert Attrition to numeric: 'Yes' = 1, 'No' = 0\ntemp_df = df.copy()\ntemp_df['AttritionNumeric'] = temp_df['Attrition'].map({'Yes': 1, 'No': 0})\n\n\n# Define bins and labels for MonthlyRate\nbins_rate = [2000, 8000, 14000, 20000, 26000, 30000]\nlabels_rate = ['2000-8000', '8001-14000', '14001-20000', '20001-26000', '26001-30000']\n\n# Create a new column with categorized MonthlyRate\ntemp_df['MonthlyRateCategory'] = pd.cut(df['MonthlyRate'], bins=bins_rate, labels=labels_rate, right=False)\n\n# Plot Attrition Distribution by MonthlyRate Category\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nsns.countplot(data=temp_df, x='MonthlyRateCategory', hue='Attrition', palette=['#8EE5EE', \"#66CDAA\"])\nplt.title(\"Attrition Distribution by MonthlyRate Category\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Monthly Rate Category\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Count\")\nplt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)\nplt.show()\n\n# Group by MonthlyRateCategory and calculate attrition rate\nattrition_rate_by_category = temp_df.groupby('MonthlyRateCategory')['AttritionNumeric'].mean()\n\n# Plot Attrition Rate by MonthlyRate Category\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nsns.barplot(x=attrition_rate_by_category.index, y=attrition_rate_by_category.values, palette=['#8EE5EE'])\nplt.title(\"Attrition Rate by MonthlyRate Category\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Monthly Rate Category\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Attrition Rate\")\nplt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)\nplt.show()\n\n#---\n# Define bins and labels for MonthlyIncome\nbins_income = [2000, 8000, 14000, 20000]\nlabels_income = ['2000-8000', '8001-14000', '14001-20000']\n\n# Create a new column with categorized MonthlyIncome\ntemp_df['MonthlyIncomeCategory'] = pd.cut(temp_df['MonthlyIncome'], bins=bins_income, labels=labels_income, right=False)\n\n# Plot Attrition Distribution by MonthlyIncome Category\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nsns.countplot(data=temp_df, x='MonthlyIncomeCategory', hue='Attrition', palette=['#8EE5EE', \"#66CDAA\"])\nplt.title(\"Attrition Distribution by MonthlyIncome Category\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Monthly Income Category\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Count\")\nplt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)\nplt.show()\n\n# Group by MonthlyIncomeCategory and calculate attrition rate\nattrition_rate_by_category = temp_df.groupby('MonthlyIncomeCategory')['AttritionNumeric'].mean()\n\n# Plot Attrition Rate by MonthlyIncome Category\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nsns.barplot(x=attrition_rate_by_category.index, y=attrition_rate_by_category.values, palette=['#8EE5EE'])\nplt.title(\"Attrition Rate by MonthlyIncome Category\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Monthly Income Category\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Attrition Rate\")\nplt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"id":"WzD0LmfjEmQ_","outputId":"2d98b048-0f5e-4f12-a5a8-619bf0577543","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-26T22:29:27.406740Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-26T22:29:27.406996Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-26T22:29:28.219147Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-26T22:29:27.406973Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-26T22:29:28.218427Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1.

To be concrete, businesses can identify which employees may be wanting to leave their position soon. This creates a better overview for human resources in the business.\nThe gained knowledge can be used to act differently. On the one hand, businesses can try to keep the company attractive specifically for those groups of people who are more likely to leave the company soon. Also conversations can be held with these employees to further specify their needs and to react to them. This way, businesses can achieve to reduce attrition and therefore reduce resources to find new employees and to onboard them. This can help a business to be more efficient.\nOn the other hand, businesses can use the gained knowledge to be prepared for possible attrition and to stay flexible, so that positions can be reoccupied in a fast process.","metadata":{}}]}
